### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
**Clockey** provides a handy addition to your time-based sports games that you (or your kids) play in the neighbourhood or in the garden.

Why do I need **Clockey**?
- Do you play Hockey or Soccer with your kids? They will love the fact that you can now correctly track the time of your game.
- Keeping track of the current score while you are fighting for every inch belongs to the past. Let Clockey handle that for you.

With **Clockey** you can:
- Track the score of your current game
- Get notified when the game is over
- Customize your game configuration. 2 halves, 3 periods, 4 quarters ... configure it based on the game **you** are playing.
- Unlimited player support
